# Macroeconomic Tracker

A project built by an aspiring macro strategist to monitor large-scale macroeconomic forces and understand how they translate into financial market behaviour.

This tracker focuses on three core dimensions of the macro environment:

---
## 1. Economic Changes
Tracking real‑economy indicators that reflect the state and momentum of the economic cycle.

- Growth indicators (GDP, PMI, Industrial Production)
- Inflation indicators (CPI, Core CPI, PPI)
- Labour market indicators (Unemployment, Wage Growth, Job Openings)
- Objective: identify turning points in growth, inflation, and employment dynamics

---

## 2. Policy Changes
Monitoring both **actual** and **potential** shifts in economic and geopolitical policy.

### Monetary Policy
- Interest rates (policy rate)
- Real policy rate (policy rate minus inflation)
- Central bank balance sheet (QE/QT)
- Money supply and liquidity conditions

### Fiscal Policy
- Government spending
- Budget deficits/surpluses
- Tax policy changes
- Debt issuance

### Geopolitical / Regulatory Policy
- Tariffs and trade restrictions
- Sanctions
- Energy and climate policy
- Capital controls and regulatory shifts

### Objective:
- Track changes already implemented
- Estimate the probability of future policy moves based on economic momentum and market signals

---

## 3. Thematic Changes
Capturing long-term structural forces that shape the macro environment.

- Technological shifts (AI, automation, productivity trends)
- Climate and energy transitions (renewables, energy security, carbon policy)
- Demographic trends (ageing populations, migration, workforce changes)
- Other structural themes influencing long-term growth, inflation, and risk premia

---

## Overall Objective
- Provide a structured, systematic view of macro forces
- Connect economic, policy, and thematic changes to potential impacts on financial markets
- Serve as a foundation for rule-based macro analysis and future strategy development
